# MULE-KICK
Native http mux perk

> Legend tells us of a man, a hero in a tortured land, where Se√±oritas lived in fear. Their lonely nights in deep despair, he was EL BURRO! (Hee-Haw, Hee-Haw). Across the fields, across the plains. He ran so fast he dodged the rain. He was El Burro! He hurried in to save the day, gun in hand, and thrice they say. He was strong like a Mule, he was stubborn like a Mule, he even kicked like a Mule, El Burro! (El Burro!). A man of equal soul they say. But some men more, it's just the way! He was El Burro! He was EL BURRO! EL BURRO!

note: this package could've been called `wunderwaffe`.. But `mulekick` seems most appropriate given ze choice.

As the name suggests, `mule-kick` gives your router (gorilla/mux in this case) power.

## Features

- Middleware
- Convenience `.get`, `.post`, ...
- Sub-routing, sub-middleware declarations

## Demo usage

```
	r := mulekick.NewRouter(mux.NewRouter(), corsMiddleware)
	r.NotFoundHandler = http.HandlerFunc(notFoundHandler)

	r.Get("/ping", mulekick.PongHandler)

	// Authentication
	func(api mulekick.Router) {
		api.Post("/password", login)
		api.Post("/register", signup)
	}(r.Group("/auth"))

	// Limited to requests with sessions
	api := mulekick.NewRouter(r.Router, corsMiddleware, secureMiddleware)

	// Fetch user
	api.Get("/user", getUser)
	// Update user details
	api.Post("/user", updateUser)
	// Update user password
	api.Post("/user/password", updateUserPassword)
```
